  <h2>Gina Truong</h2>
  <p>I was born in Montreal, Quebec where my father's family resides in. My parents were not originally from there, but
    decided to visit mid July 1983. I guess...I wanted to be with the Canadian culture, and made a decision to come a
    bit early on July 25th.</p>
  <p>I was raised in the states, where I stayed in Los Angeles for a few years until my dad made a decision to bring me
    to YEE-HAW Texas. Back in the early 1990s, there's basically nothing </p>
