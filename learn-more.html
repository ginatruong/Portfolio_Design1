    <h2>Gina Truong</h2>
    <p>I was born in Montreal, Quebec where my father's family resides in. My parents were not originally from there,
      but
      decided to visit mid July 1983. I guess...I wanted to be with the Canadian culture, and made a decision to come a
      bit early on July 25th.</p>
    <p>I was raised in the states, where I stayed in Los Angeles for a few years until my dad made a decision to bring
      me
      to YEE-HAW Texas. Back in the early 1990s, there's basically nothing. </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>FOOD - I love everything about food. Food places. Food creativity. Food ideas. Places that ARE worth your time
      and money. I love hole in the wall restaurants. I love HISTORY.</p>
    <p>I am not a big yelper. I do not like to READ a novel about shitty customer service, I don't want to read about if
      it takes forever or complaints that are not even valid. If the food is GREAT, and their cleanliness is on point,
      why be petty and go ruin someone's business just because they are trying to accomodate you. If you can sit behind
      your screen and write a novel, consider what is a <span><strong>true</strong> FOOD CRITIC</span> before crying
      about it.</p>

  <h2>Travel</h2>
  <section class="travel">
    <p>Talk about traveling! I enjoy sightseeing, anything that has to do with mountains and lakes. I am in love with
      Colorado, and I am not big on cities. I already live in a big city, so surrounding myself with beautiful nature is
      my big getaway.</p>
    <h3>A little side note before I get side track.</h3>
    <p>My goal this year would be to learn about European culture. I have dug my head so deep into work, that I forgot
      what it was like to ask myself what I like, what are the most important things in my life, what do I love doing,
      and what do I look forward to do when I leave WORK. I used </p>
