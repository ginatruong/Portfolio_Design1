    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Data Analyst by day, Web-Developer by night. WanderLust. I love food, but I am not a big yelper, however -
      I am big on researching on places by their creativity. I give recommendations on where to EAT, where to satisfy
      your craving, and help you understand the statistics that it is worth making a drive out of your comfort zone.</p>

      <p>Talking about our family business, Gina has taken on the initiative to create websites for our spa salon
        businesses for years. Her websites are very detailed, and super user-friendly for our customers. She was a tool
        for our marketing needs, and she still continues to educate herself with new tools to maintain our site every
        year.</p>

      <p>Talking about compassion, she came here with an open heart and has been volunteering at our facility for
        several years. She leads by examples in many ways. Her kindness, compassion, and strength help us find a good
        home for our little furry family. Her time and effort for building projects and websites have helped our
        organization grow in the last few years, and we wouldn't have grown this far if it weren't for time.</p>
